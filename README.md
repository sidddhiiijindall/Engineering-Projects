# Engineering-Projects
Projects using C++ and Python
# Applied Software Engineering Portfolio (2026)

This repository contains core software projects developed to apply concepts of **Data Security**, **File Systems**, and **Data Automation**. These projects serve as a practical application of my **Google Cloud Arcade** and **Cisco Cybersecurity** certifications.

 Featured Projects

 1. IronFolder (C++)
A cryptographic utility designed to secure local files through symmetric encryption logic.
* **Technical Logic:** Utilizes bitwise **XOR operations** and binary stream handling to ensure data confidentiality.
* **Key Achievement:** Successfully processes multiple file formats (.pdf, .png, .txt) by maintaining 100% data integrity in binary mode.
* **Certification Link:** Directly applies the Confidentiality pillar of the CIA Triad from my Cisco Cybersecurity training.

2. Expense Tracker (Python)
A personal finance tracking tool focused on data persistence and automated reporting.
* **Technical Logic:** Implements **CSV file handling** and dictionary mapping for efficient data storage.
* **Key Achievement:** Features robust error handling (Try-Except blocks) to validate user input and prevent data corruption.
* **Certification Link:** Inspired by infrastructure logging and data monitoring labs from the **Google Cloud Arcade** program.
